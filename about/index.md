title: About me
---
I'm mesmerized by world of tech, as both human and machine work together to achieve great things. When I was in high school I was really amazed and inspired by technology around me, so I started working on my programming skills then. I taught my self basics of C in high school. Now I'm pursuing BE in computer science at [MET Bhujbal Knowledge City](https://metbhujbalknowledgecity.ac.in/) in India.
Where I am honing my coding skills by working on: improving my Java, C++ fluency, also learning different paradigm to achieve excellence.

Out of compute science, I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, solving mathematical problems and repairing things. You can find me coding at night at Inerton Technologies.
