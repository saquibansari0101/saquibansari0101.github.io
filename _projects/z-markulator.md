Markulator is fast, reliable marks handling app for a class which gives you addition features like average marks of whole class.

The app was written in Java using Android Studio as IDE. I Learned how to use fragments, how to control fragments, how to use SQLite database in app and how to do CRUD operations on databse etc.
