Quotify was built to entertain the quote enthusiast around the world by fetching quotes at tip of buttons. It's easy to use.

The app was written in Dart using Android Studio as IDE. I Learned how to fetch data from api and how to map their JSON responses, how to use different widget of flutter and also learned to add custom fonts.
