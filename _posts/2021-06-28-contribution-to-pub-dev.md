Recently, I have been working on an android project and I needed wanted to do the drop shadow on an image. But unfortunately I didn't find any package for drop shadow. So I ended up designing one package.

While building this package. I endulged myself into the reasearch of many different widgets and at the end I successfully made the package, named as drop_shadow_image.

You can find my uploaded package [here](https://pub.dev/packages/drop_shadow_image)
