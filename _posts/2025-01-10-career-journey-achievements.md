title: My Journey from College to Backend Engineering Excellence
---

As I reflect on my journey from a computer engineering student to a backend engineer at Infosys, I'm grateful for the experiences, challenges, and achievements that have shaped my career.

## The Beginning

I started coding at 17, learning C and discovering my love for problem-solving. Mathematics had always fascinated me since 4th grade, and programming felt like the perfect blend of logic and creativity.

During my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at MET BKC Institute of Engineering, Nashik, I maintained a CGPA of 9.61 while exploring various technologies—from C++ and Java to Python and Dart.

## Early Professional Experience

### Flutter Developer at Inerton (Aug 2021 - Jan 2022)

My first professional role was as a remote Flutter developer at Inerton. I:
- Built Android applications from scratch
- Developed reusable Flutter packages
- Led UI enhancements for textile industry applications
- Contributed to **Badli**, a social-impact platform helping daily wage textile workers find jobs

This experience taught me the importance of user-centric design and building for real-world impact.

## Joining Infosys

In July 2022, I joined Infosys as a Digital Specialist Engineer L1. What started as a graduate role quickly evolved into opportunities to lead technical initiatives and own critical systems.

### Major Projects

**EAIGLE Integration**  
Designed and implemented a real-time data integration pipeline streaming trailer, load, and shipment data using Kafka and CDC. This system now processes events for a global supply chain, enabling near-real-time visibility.

**SAP to Kafka Integration**  
Acted as technical lead, architecting a scalable pipeline that ingests 1M+ records from SAP into Kafka, powering multiple downstream consumers.

**Warehouse Dashboard**  
Co-architected a real-time monitoring dashboard integrating decentralized warehouse systems globally. This platform became mission-critical for the client's operations team.

**Data Validation Suite**  
Designed a customizable framework using Python, Pandas, and NumPy that improved data accuracy and consistency across disparate databases.

## Recognition and Awards

The hard work has been incredibly rewarding:

- **Outstanding Performance Rating** - 2023/24 & 2024/25 cycles
- **Infosys Rise Award** - Exceptional Performance (Feb 2025)
- **PepsiCo Accounts Award** - Exceptional Performance (Feb 2024)
- **Infosys Insta Award** - Re-skilling & Performance (Jan 2024)

These recognitions validate not just technical skills but also the ownership, collaboration, and commitment I bring to every project.

## Technical Growth

Over 3.5 years, I've developed deep expertise in:

- **Backend Engineering**: Java, Spring Boot, Python, FastAPI
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka, CDC, real-time data processing
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Azure DevOps CI/CD
- **Architecture**: Microservices, REST APIs, distributed systems
- **Databases**: Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB

## Personal Projects

Beyond work, I've built several personal projects:

- **Wage Wise**: A desktop billing application for textile sizing businesses
- **Drop Shadow Image Package**: An open-source Flutter package on pub.dev
- **AI Traffic Management System**: A reinforcement learning project that improved traffic flow efficiency by 35%

## Certifications

I'm committed to continuous learning:
- Google Professional Data Analytics (Coursera)
- Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals (Coursera)
- Python, Java, SQL (HackerRank)
- Power BI Workshop

## What's Next

I'm passionate about building reliable distributed systems and deepening my expertise in cloud-native infrastructure. My goal is to continue solving complex technical challenges while mentoring others and contributing to impactful projects.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Ownership matters**: Taking end-to-end responsibility drives excellence
2. **Never stop learning**: Technology evolves rapidly; continuous learning is essential
3. **Impact over output**: Focus on solving real problems, not just writing code
4. **Collaboration is key**: The best solutions come from working with diverse teams
5. **Quality is non-negotiable**: Code quality, reliability, and operational excellence should never be compromised

The journey has been incredible so far, and I'm excited about what lies ahead. If you're on a similar path, remember: stay curious, embrace challenges, and always strive for excellence.
